        description:  "I consider myself a persistent person who likes challenges, knowing how to learn new things and put them into practice. I have always been curious and   attracted to technology, but I had never set out to work on something directly related to it. As new information and communication technologies have evolved, I have become aware of their potential and the job opportunities offered by this field. That's why I decided to embark on the adventure of training in software development. The programming language that I like the most is JavaScript, because of its versatility, where I would like to go more into the backend area.",
